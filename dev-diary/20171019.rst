Plan for the 18th of October, 2017
##################################

These are the task for today

- Incorporate valgrind into the workflow
- Work on CI build
- Design a Simple GUI for the interpreter that runs on QT5


Diary
=====

Setup Valgrind
==============
- hand made modification to Makefile to correctly look for the header file for MacOSX
-  replaced
-   /usr/include/mach/
-   with
-   /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk/usr/include/mach/

Workflow Execution Valgrind
===========================
Setup a parallel run of the test run inside valgrind

- refactor of the already existing tests is completed
- CONS: we might have problem with problem inside googletest
- PRO:
-  already written test subject
-  tests include code path generated by failing scanning/parsing/interpretation scenario

Recovered the REPL shell (EXTRA)
================================
Fixed the build to create nanolisp and recovered the code to run a REPL interpreter.
