##################################

These are the task for today

- Work on CI build with travis-ci
- Prepare a plan for in-house tool to get code-quality
- Design a Simple GUI for the interpreter that runs on QT5

Travis-CI
=========

This continuous integration service is convenient because it cost nothing and it is triggered by repository update from github.

The current project setup requires us to run the build on one of the latest version of CMake, which means one of the latest version of Ubuntu.

Travis-CI option for this kind of setup is not run a prebuilt environment but to link to a docker image.

The plan is to build it directly on 17.04


*Being able to test a built on different versions of a Operating System is a great feature to have on the long run*

We clearly need to think about this for the in-house continuous integration.


Docker
======
The plan is to setup a reusable docker image, through a series of commands or a dockerfile which we can use to run the builder and the test runner.
